# Machine-Learning-2-Predicting-Listener-Adoption

Website XYZ, which is a music-listening social networking website, follows
the “freemium” business model. The website offers basic services for free, and provides a number
of additional premium capabilities for a monthly subscription fee. We are interested in predicting
which people would be likely to convert from free users to premium subscribers in the next 6-
month period, if they are targeted by our promotional campaign. We have a dataset from the previous 
marketing campaign which targeted a number of nonsubscribers.
